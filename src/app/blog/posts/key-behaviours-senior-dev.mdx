Becoming a senior developer is less about reaching a milestone and more about embodying certain behaviors that demonstrate professionalism, technical expertise, and leadership. Reflecting on my journey, here are some key behaviors that helped me grow into a senior role.

## 1. Communicate clearly  

Clear communication is a cornerstone of effective collaboration, especially in technical environments. One of the most critical aspects is setting realistic expectations with stakeholders.  

**For example:**  
If a feature is technically complex or constrained by time, it's crucial to explain why the complete solution might not be feasible within the deadline. Avoid overpromising; instead, focus on realistic outcomes.

### How to succeed:
When communicating constraints, suggest alternative paths:  
- **Explain technical challenges to non-technical stakeholders:** Use metaphors or simple analogies to ensure your point is understood without sounding condescending. Treat product owners and project managers as allies, working together to find solutions.
- **Propose simpler alternatives:** Propose a simpler version of the feature as an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to meet immediate deadlines while planning incremental improvements later.  

## 2. Make your work visible  

Keeping your progress visible not only builds trust but also prevents micromanagement. It’s a simple habit that signals your maturity and consistency.  

### Track your progress:
- Move your task to “In Progress” when you start.  
- Create a pull request (PR) early and commit regularly. Push your code to remote daily—even unfinished work has value in showing progress.  
- Encountered a blocker? Leave comments on the issue or task describing what happened. Transparency is better than silence.  

### Why it matters:
By making your work visible, you allow your manager to see how you’re progressing without requiring constant check-ins. They can easily check your task board or PRs, identify potential challenges, and provide timely support.

## 3. Get involved  

Engagement goes beyond coding—it’s about investing in your team and its success.

- **Lead initiatives:** If your team doesn’t already have activities like knowledge-sharing sessions or tech debt discussions, take the initiative to organize them. This shows your commitment to improving the team’s processes and culture.  
- **Contribute to existing sessions:** If such ceremonies already exist, actively participate, provide feedback, and suggest new ideas for the team to explore.

Your involvement demonstrates a proactive mindset and positions you as a leader, even before formal titles come into play.

## 4. Dive into Technical Analysis  

Taking part in technical analysis is an excellent way to deepen your understanding of the codebase, especially when you're new to a team.  

### Benefits:
- **Broader exposure:** You’ll explore a range of issues and areas in the codebase without the pressure of immediately delivering a feature or fixing a bug.
- **Contextual understanding:** This helps you connect the dots between the product’s needs and the technical solutions, making you more effective in future tasks.

## 5. Start leading projects  

Once you’ve established yourself with the behaviors above, take the next step by leading smaller projects.

### Steps to get started:
- Speak with your manager and stakeholders about your interest in leading projects.  
- Begin with low-stakes or smaller initiatives and gradually increase the complexity.  
- If possible, co-lead projects with someone experienced to gain insights and share responsibilities.

Leadership is a skill you build over time, and leading projects allows you to practice decision-making, communication, and technical ownership.

## Final thoughts  

Growing into a senior developer is about more than just writing excellent code—it’s about demonstrating responsibility, fostering collaboration, and driving team success. By focusing on clear communication, transparency, engagement, and leadership, you’ll not only excel individually but also elevate your team and projects.  

These behaviors may seem small in isolation, but together, they paint the picture of a senior developer who is professional, reliable, and ready to tackle challenges head-on.
